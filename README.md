# India Air Quality Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of India's air quality dataset (`city_day.xlsx`).  
The dataset includes pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and AQI.  
The project focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

# Dataset Overview
- Dataset: city_day.xlsx  
- Rows: ~[6236, 16]  
- Columns: City, Date, PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, AQI, AQI_Bucket  
- Time Range: 2015 – 2020 (varies per city)  
- Cities Covered: Multiple (e.g., Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai, etc.)
  
# Objectives
- Analyze trends of air pollutants across cities and dates.  
- Identify the most and least polluted days using AQI.  
- Create visual dashboards (Power BI) for city-wise comparisons.  
- Provide actionable insights for environmental awareness.  

# Tools & Skills Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Visualization: Power BI, Excel  
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers  
- Skills: Data Wrangling, Dashboard Design, Data Storytelling
  
# Key Insights
- Seasonal trends in PM2.5 and PM10.  
- Identification of the top 3 most polluted cities.  
- AQI bucket analysis to determine health impacts.  
- Correlation of NO2, SO2, and O3 with overall AQI.
